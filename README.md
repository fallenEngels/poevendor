# Path of Exile Vendor Trade Tracker

Are you tired of manually keeping track of collected and missing items for farming Chaos or Regal Orbs in PoE?
Me too. So I made a small (somewhat horrible) program to make this part of playing more convenient.

I tried to keep the window as small as possible, so it should be usable even on one-screen setups. Can be forced to always stay on top of other windows, so it should even work while playing PoE in fullscreen mode.

PSA: Base Colours for item slots are based on filterbase's standard settings. If you have modified those for your item filter or want different colours, just edit settings.ini with colours of your choice.

How to use: Take both files out of the User Files folder and put them in a folder of your choosing. Keep them in the same folder though, otherwise it might cause some issues.

Update: Added Save on exit - automatically saves stored values in ini file and reloads them on next startup.
